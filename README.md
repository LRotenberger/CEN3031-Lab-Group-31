# TrashPath

    TrashPath is a mobile application that uses mapping and geotagging functionality to allow users to upload and search for locations where garbage can be properly disposed of. When adding a geotag, the user is prompted to apply any amount of the six provided material types that are able to be disposed of at the location they're adding. Users can then search for any of those materials and see corresponding tags on the map around them. This application was designed to help reduce littering and pollution as well as to promote recycling efforts.



    Currently, the application runs within the Expo environment, and can be accessed by downloading the Expo app on a mobile device. NOTE: The app has not been tested in iOS and therefore may require an android emulator to run if you don't have access to a mobile android device. Once in Expo, head to the published project located at https://expo.dev/@pfefpo/trashpath and either scan the QR Code or open the provided link.
